Martina K,"Great course, covering the basics. Mock interview section is brilliant. I wish the autor could do a follow up course in more details, covering topics from more industries like e.g. fintech.",4.5,2023-11-04
Anwesh Datla,"This course does a great job in answering how to approach a system design interview. While it doesn't focus on granular technical details, this course taught me that thinking from customer perspective is way more important than anything else.",4.5,2023-11-07
Kubik,"This course is very shallow. Frank doesn't dive deep into topics at all, and mostly just calls out existing tech. Sure you'll know all about how Amazon Redshift is a thing, but you'll never deepen your understanding of how it works.

The mock interviews are shallow as well. Frank solves everything in <8 mins with a very high level design while reading off of his notes. Its not engaging, it doesn't teach me very much at all. 

The only saving grace of this course is that it gives you a template to follow. Thats it.",2.0,2023-12-14
Alejandro Leonian,"This is my first encounter with this subject and I have learned new concepts here and there but I think the course is not very well designed.
At times I was pretty confused by the approach taken by Frank. Sometimes he approaches the subject in a generic way, sometimes he is very specific. 
The 'general tips' for interviews are good but overall I feel the need to get another course or book on the subject since I'm not confident this one gave me what I need.",3.0,2023-10-31
Subash Balakrishnan,"From the very beginning, the instructor's teaching style was engaging and easy to follow. The course started by laying a strong foundation in system design, explaining key concepts and principles, making it accessible even for beginners. As the course progressed, it seamlessly transitioned into more complex topics, such as design patterns, algorithms, and best practices, which really solidified my understanding of the subject.

The instructor's expertise in the field was evident, and they presented the material with clarity and precision. Their ability to break down complex concepts into digestible chunks made it easier to grasp the content. Additionally, the use of visuals, diagrams, walkthroughs added depth to the explanations, making the learning process even more enjoyable.

I appreciated the flexibility of the course structure, allowing me to learn at my own pace. The high-quality production and clear audio made it a pleasure to watch the lectures, and the downloadable resources provided a valuable reference to revisit concepts later.",5.0,2023-08-01

Varun Garg,"This is a great course. Getting an insight from a person who has taken thousands of interviews at one of the biggest tech companies - Amazon. This course does teach you the basics and then apply them to real design problems.
The only thing I think would have been better is rather than going into Algorithms and Data Structures if it would have taken few more design problems.",4.5,2023-10-23

Sofi Flink,"I like a lot of the content, but I feel like there is a lot left to be desired. This is probably a course better suited for people with hands on experience with system design and databases. There where now a lot of detail going through the theory, and mostly I felt the quizzes where not enough to test our knowledge. In order to learn, repetition is necessary! I did not feel like I learned all the different tools needed to properly work with the interview questions on my own, and some times, the lecturer name dropped other technologies or tools that had not been previously discussed in the course. 

Overall I think it has good content though, and for the experienced programmer working with system design and databases, a great course to understand the interview process.",3.0,2023-06-19

All the concepts are explained in a pretty simple manner. what makes this course different from others is that instructor explained each and every concept in very much detailed and also in a very simplistic manner.

Vytautas Mizgiris,"Good coverage of system design principles and concepts. I liked the toolbox idea. I felt like it was a little too focused on specific products, e.g. AWS and Google Search, and little mention of open source tools. Mock interviews could have gone in a little bit more detail about ""what could have been done better during the interview"", and less reading out from a piece of paper presenting pretty much an already done solution - seemed rushed and not much like an actual interview.",3.0,2023-06-19

Michael Pardee,"I thought that the mock interview section glossed over too much.  The answers were all very high level and repetitive.  They made comments like ""we can't do everything in 20 minutes"" but they only spent like 5 minutes per question, and I don't think any real interview is going to only dedicate 5 minutes to those kind of questions.  Maybe some other more tractable problems explored more thoroughly would have been better.

Dylan Powers,"This is a good course if you're really new to system design, but if you already have even a little experience, this course probably won't tell you anything you don't already know. I did find the mock interview section really useful, although the timing of the interviews doesn't seem realistic, i.e. designing a search engine in 10 minutes. In reality, you would have 45+ minutes to solve this problem.

Sagnik Sinha,"The course was amazing for someone who is an experienced cs engineer but, hasn't had much exposure to system design interviews before. The basics are covered in great detail. All the stuff about distributed DBs, CDNs, Caches, LBs is absolutely top knotch. However, things started going a bit over my head when it came to Big Data. Maybe coz I have had no experience in regard to Big data prior to this. (I am an FE engineer). Having finished the course, I probably need to go back and look at the Big Data section, especially, Apache Spark. A little more detail on Kubernetes and Docker would have been good too. Some parts of the Design Interview section felt a bit rushed. For instance, building youtube is fine. But, what about data transmission to the client? How does the client consume it? Surely, it doesn't download the entire video before playing it. There are concepts of Blob and data chunks involved right? A bit more of a dive into those topics might have been great.",4.0,2023-06-19

I had a kind of no idea about designing large-scale systems before doing this course, the most complex design I could think about before was a web server with a DB server and some daily backups. 
I had done the course twice in 10 days before I had my first system design interview ever, and it went pretty well ""I hope"".

I have learned a lot from Frank.
This is a course that I really advise anybody to take before Interviewing with FAANG.

For sure you will need more practice & to enrich your knowledge as many topics were mentioned.

But at least you can you will know what you will be basically needing and start from there as system design is a really intense and big field.

Don't be afraid if you are just like me; in the end, we can't keep starting at oceans and just be afraid because we don't trust our swimming skills; the more we learn; the more comfortable that we will be.

If you are thinking if this course is worth it or not ;

My answer from experience; is absolutely yes; You will definitely learn something new from frank or at least benifit from the set of advice

udemy user,"It's a decent course but the mock interviews are really short (10 minutes or less). There's a self-imposed 20-minute time limit by the ""interviewer"" which serves as an excuse to cut the interviews short. Also, the mock interviews sound very scripted/rehearsed so they aren't really imitating what you'll see in real-life. Lastly, some important topics aren't discussed such as concurrency and security.",2.5,2023-06-19
Paulo Roberto Silva de Azevedo,"The content is excellent, and Frank has a vast experience as a Hiring Manager. Both the technical points discussed and what a hiring manager is looking for are very valuable.  Although, in the beginning, I had an impression that the building blocks were not covered deeply, when you go to the mock interviews and tips, you see that they are not looking for you be a specialist in everything and that they also were not expecting to have a perfect solution, the main goal is to see how you interact with them, how persistent and honest you are, how you can develop new ideas or tackle something that you don't know but has the grit to dove deep and sketch something reasonable. Definitely, I recommend this course to anyone looking to land a job in a big tech company.",5.0,2023-06-19

On a negative side, many items are glanced over and I recall not completely agreeing on couple of points (having worked very closely with some of the mentioned tech).

Next good thing is the 'Designing System at scale' section. It's reasonably detailed and for me it made it much easier to follow the mock interviews part.
 
Not the best part is one related to data structures / algos. In my opinion it doesn't put much value here. If somebody has some deficiency in this area, one can find better materials to learn it.

The ""mock interview"" part in particular to me felt very unnatural - I understand it's supposed to be acting, but the answers are particularly selected to reflect stuff shown in the first half of the course - and the first half to the course itself is distilled on purpose to reinforce the mock interviews in the second half.

What I think would make this course better is if Frank used his mouse/pointer more while going over the way the system flows. It's easier to keep up with what he's talking about that way.

The working with Big Data section is particularly bad as the information provided isn't useful for an actual interview. He also includes information about Coding Interviews (all of section 3) and behavioral interview questions which aren't relevant to a System Design interview.

Alex Hladun,"The first sections are quite good.
The design solutions for popular problems are very high level. The solutions provided there will definitely not satisfy the interviewer.
Some of the ideas that the author describes are good, however, he does not show how to implement them e.g:
1) Url Shortener. There is mentioned base32 encoding of some incremented integer value, which is good. But it is not clear which component is responsible for autoincrementing? The proposed database DynamoDb doesn't provide this functionality, do we want to use a dedicated service for that? If so why it is included in the diagram?
2) Restaurant Reservation System. The Reservation flow is not covered at all. What if multiple users will try to book the same table simultaneously? Apparently, this part needs to be synchronized somehow, maybe a distributed lock should be used? Any other solutions to this problem? Nothing of that is covered.
I don't want to go further and touch problems with other design questions but I hope you understand what I am concerned about.
